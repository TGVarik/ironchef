He battled Iron Chef Chen Kenichi back in 1995, in the Scampi Battle. He is considered one of the best pasta chefs in Japan. This has to be the first battle where the challenger actually has more experience in Kitchen Stadium than the Iron Chef.

He then tells the challenger, \\\"Of course, today you will not be doing battle with these three.\\\"\n\nThe first thing you will notice once the gong of fate sounds is that deliberate pace with which Kobe approaches the theme. This may be the only time I have ever seen him not running to the podium to get his ingredients. He is moving as slowly as I have ever seen him move. Every now and then, Kobe gets a look of confusion, but that is somewhat understandable as it is his first battle. (And does Otah talk fast or what? I try to listen for words I know, but geez is he fast.) They keep mentioning the fact that Kobe is 27 years old.\n\nIn the royal box today are challengers from previous battles.
